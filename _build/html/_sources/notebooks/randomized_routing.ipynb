        "# **Randomized Routing** #\n",
        "## Introduction \n",
        "  Traditionally, algorithms have been designed to improve/bound the worst case performance on a problem. Such algorithms draw deep insights into the problem and carefully design and use datastructures. On the other hand, there are simpler algorithms which work very well on an average input while performing much worse on smaller number of bad inputs. QuickSort is a classic example of such an algorithm for sorting. While MergeSort has worst case complexity of $O(nlogn)$, QuickSort performs $O(nlogn)$ on random input and can perform upto $O(n^2)$ on *bad* inputs. On average inputs, QuickSort is *quicker* than MergeSort with lesser memory requirement, inplace operations and, hence, better cache utilization ([see link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quicksort-better-mergesort/)). Can the issue of *bad* inputs be solved to avoid worst case performance? As it turns out, the answer to *almost* solving the problem is Randomization. *Bad* inputs for QuickSort turn out to be ones when the elements are already ordered. So what if we randomly shuffle the array before running QuickSort? A simple trick like this would actually resolve the issue of bad inputs. In implementation, [Randomized QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) randomly partitions the array (by choosing random pivot) and has an expected complexity (over random pivots) of $O(nlogn)$ for **any input**. Though worst case is still $O(n^2)$, note that for this algorithm, there are no *bad* inputs; only bad pivot choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "  As a general principle, we can utilize simpler algorithms which work well on an *average / random / uniform* inputs to solve the original problem with no restrictions on inputs. Randomized routing is another classic example. Here, we utilize an algorithm that is already good when the input is uniformly distributed. To make this algorithm work for generic input, all we require is clever randomization that tranforms the problem on any given input to (multiple) instances of the same problem with random input.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lecture, we study the problem of routing messages in distributed computation. In distributed computing, the idea is to distribute computation to different nodes on cluster and consolidate individual outputs to achieve original computation. In the process, messages have to be passed among nodes on the cluster. If the traffic on the cluster is large (i.e. there is congestion), there can be significant delays in message passing and will cause the overall computation to take longer. The task is to minimize the delays caused by congestion. We show how randomization helps in reducing the congestion delays. For simplicity of analysis, we assume Grid network architecture and permutation messaging paradigm of communication. However, the general usage of randomization in routing goes beyond these simplistic assumptions. "

        "In very large clusters, every node cannot be connected to every other node. In such a case, nodes are connected to few other nodes and when a message has to be passed from one node to other, it has to determine a path to traverse. We consider a specific arrangement of nodes called grid model. Consider that we have $N=2^n$ nodes in our graph. We identify each of the nodes with binary strings. We would need $log_2(N)=n$ bits to identify N different nodes. In grid model, the two nodes are connected only if they have hamming distance exactly 1; i.e. their binary string ids have only one bit mismatch. So each node hash a out degree equal to number of bits in its representation , i.e. n. The message can be passed in any direction. Hence total degree is 2n. We can see that the total number of directed edges in the graph view of Grid model is nN . In figure 1 a grid model for N=8 is shown.\n",

Essentially, we cannot store any history of the packet traversal. We only have the destination information on each packet. As a result, it is impertative that the routing protocol is memoryless. More specifically, if a packet arrives at any node, just on the basis of its destination, we should be able to determine the next hop (or node) of this packet. This requirement rules out a lot of optimal algorithms. It turns out that there is a simple and clever strtegy, which is memoryless and ensures that no link is travered by the packet twice. \n",

Before delving into the actual problem, its always advisable to look at simpler version of the problem to understand its properties.

When an algorithm is run on a uniformly sampled input (random), the algorithm has good running time with high probability. However, in general, there are many structured inputs, which can very well occur in practice; the performance is terrible. We can make such algorithms work for generic inputs by somehow converting the problem where we only run the algorithm over random inputs and still solve for any given (potentially structured and poorly performing) inputs. The conversion is dependent on the problem. For routing, by enforcing a random permutation of intermediate destinations, we were able to break the original problem with any given source-destination sequence to two problems where either the source or the destination is uniformly shuffled. \n",

One important thing to note is that every packet can at most add a delay of 1 unit to the other packet. This is because a packet j can only \\textit{join} the path of i at one single point.
